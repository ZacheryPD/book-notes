* What is this?

  This is a repository where I am keeping notes for books I've read. In
  particular, this holds mostly code examples that I've written into Org mode
  files.

  
* Why publish this repo?

  1. I wanted to be able to link to these notes to reference later.
  2. I hope that my notes and thoughts might be helpful to someone else at some
     point.

* I see plagiarism, what should I do?

  Tell me! I don't intend to reproduce the books I am taking notes on, and I do
  not expect anyone to be reading these notes instead of those books. If I have
  copied something verbatim without citing it, I didn't intend to and I will
  remove it.
